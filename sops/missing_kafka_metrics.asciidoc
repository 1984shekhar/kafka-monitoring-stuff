= Missing Kafka Metrics

toc::[]

== Description

The purpose of this SOP is to describe the process of resolving/debugging kafka metrics issues.

This SOP may be followed if metrics are missing from observatorium.

== Prerequisites

* Access to the data plane cluster ( credentials can be found in vault.devshift.net )
* Access to observatorium ( credentials can be found in vault.devshift.net ) 

== Execute/Resolution

=== Verify metrics are not being scraped

1. Get prometheus route 

    oc get routes kafka-prometheus -n managed-application-services-observability

1. Open prometheus route in browser.
1. Click `Status` and in dropdown menu `Targets`.
1. Check red targets which mean the scrape has failed.
1. Take note of the `Endpoint` address that has failed to scrape.

=== Verify scrape failure

1. Get the prometheus pod name 

    oc get pods -n managed-application-services-observability

1. rsh to the oauth-proxy pod 

    oc rsh -n managed-application-services-observability -c oauth-proxy <POD-NAME>

1. `curl <ENDPOINT-ADDRESS>`
1. If the curl times out restart the operator pod

=== Restart operator pod

1. Get the deployment name 
    
    oc get deployments -n redhat-managed-kafka-operator

1. Scale the deployment to 0 

    oc scale <OPERATOR-DEPLOYMENT> --replicas=0 -n redhat-managed-kafka-operator

1. Scale the deployment to 1 
    
    oc scale <OPERATOR-DEPLOYMENT> --replicas=1 -n redhat-managed-kafka-operator

1. Wait for the pod to come back to running state 
    
    watch oc get pods -n redhat-managed-kafka-operator


== Validate

1. Open prometheus route in browser.
1. Click `Status` and in dropdown menu `Targets`.
1. Verify the target is now green 
1. Open thanos route for observatorium
1. Verify metrics are being correctly reported
